    <Text>SOLANUM:  This was my school, where we both are standing. Here, I learned about the universe: stars, space, and time. I assume it's not a safe place anymore. I'm unsure, but I remember the black hole being smaller.</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: As a student, I was imagining the universe collapse. Conoy told me it wouldn't happen in our lifetimes. That was scary to think about. But what comes after? Perhaps it forms something new.</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: It might be unsafe here, so I brought this gravity crystal. On this planet, space and time are inextricably linked and limited.</Text>

    <Text>SOLANUM: I suppose this crystal is not completely stable. It's probably because of the black hole's increasing fluctuations. Be careful here.</Text>
