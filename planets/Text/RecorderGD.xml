    <Text>SOLANUM: Still, strangers from another star system had important knowledge. They had technology that could understand the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Eye</color>]]> better. I have a hypothesis that the <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Eye</color>]]> is dangerous, based on their vision. However, their interpretation could be wrong.</Text>
